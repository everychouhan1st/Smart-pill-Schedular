About one third of older adults are prescribed to take eight or more medications each day. With such a large amount of prescriptions, the consequences of forgetting to take medications at a particular time or, worse, accidentally taking the same medication twice are significantly high. It is noted that greater than 80 percent of elderly hospitalizations due to harmful drug reactions are caused by dosage errors. To combat such situations, our project pill scheduler employs a method to segregate the medicines at the start itself and remind the user about the medicines through an alarm and open the appropriate slot according to the schedule.
